DevCon in Bangkok was incredible. Thanks to a grant from the ENS DAO Public Goods Working Group, we had hundreds of Firefly DevKits to give away to developers for free. Here are some highlights from the week.

## How to build a hardware wallet 

Richard gave a talk at DevCon on how to build a hardware wallet. Our wallet firmware wasn't quite ready to demo, but that didn't dampen the interest in Firefly. After the talk we managed to give out ~200 Firefly DevKits and there were still people who missed out! It was mayhem, but the good kind.

The conference venue was incredible and we did laps from one end to the other, bumping into people and giving away Firefly DevKits as we went. By the end of the week we realised it was easier if we stayed in the same place and let people find us.

## Late Night Delivery

One of the most memorable moments came late at night when we rushed across the venue around 11pm to catch the Skylock team before they left for the airport. Despite being on a tight schedule, they made time for a quick meetup to pick up their Firefly Devkits. We're serious about supporting security researchers, and this was one small way to show it.

## EthGlobal Bangkok Hackathon

Richard, Loo, and Alisha were at the EthGlobal Hackathon in Bangkok talking to developers and giving out Firefly DevKits.

We did the rounds of all the booths at the event, giving out Firefly DevKits and listening to the amazing ideas people had about how they plan to modify and customize Firefly.
