We're very grateful to the ENS DAO Public Goods Working Group for awarding Firefly it's very first grant for $50k USDC.

The funds will be used for two purposes:
1. Developer Bounty Program — to distribute grants to developers contributing to Firelfy; and 
2. Distribute Firefly Pixie DevKits — Distribute 2,000 Firefly DevKits to Ethereum developers in person at conferences.
