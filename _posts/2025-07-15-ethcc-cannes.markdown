ETHCC 8 in Cannes was a blast! The Firefly team spent the week attending events and catching up with familar and new friends. 

## OPSEC Salon 

Richard gave a talk titled "Trust Permanence" at the OPSEC Salon by Aleo and Creed. It was great to have an audience of security researchers asking questions about Firefly!

## Team Time 

The highlight of any conference is always the meals that we're able to share as a team. One of the best features of Cannes was how walkable it was. With the ETHCC venue being in a central location, there were plenty of opportunities for serendipitous connections and it was always easy to find a cafe or restraurant to pop into. Cannes was a lot of fun, albeit a few degrees warmer than comfortable. We're looking forward to returning next year!
