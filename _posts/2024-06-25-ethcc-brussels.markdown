ETHCC 7 in Brussels was the very first time Firefly made it's debut in real life. It was a race against the clock to receive all of the components in time before Richard's flight. Thankfully everything arrived in time!

We spent a bunch of time hanging out outside the ETHCC venue, which turned out to be a great place to catch lots of familiar faces. 

The EthGlobal Hackathon was a lot of fun, as usual. We even saw the first ever hack on Firefly, which was really exciting.
