      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question"><span class="faq-number">1</span>What kind of chip does Firefly use?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Firefly uses an ESP32-C3, a 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller chip. It runs at 160 MHz, with 400 KB of RAM and 16 MB of flash memory. This chip supports USB-C for power and data (JTAG and CDC-ACM) and includes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity.</div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question"><span class="faq-number">2</span>Is Firefly secure hardware?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">The Firefly DevKit does currently include secure boot, so that it's easier for developers to play with. Future devices will have a secure boot option. 
         <br/><br/> 
        Firefly does not currently have a secure enclave because in most cases this requires a secure element, which are generally not open-source and rely on secure through obscurity. We are currently working on secure enclave equivalent solutions that would provide the same benefits of a secure element while being open-source and transparent.</div>
