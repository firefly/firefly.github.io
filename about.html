  <h2>Our Priorities</h2>
  <div class="values-grid">
    <div class="value-block">
      <h3>üîê Security</h3>
      <p>
        Firefly is open-hardware and open-source ‚Äî you can trust your Firefly device without trusting us.
        Developers can build their own hardware, customize their own firmware, experiment with signing flows, and design security
        setups tailored to their own threat models.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-block">
      <h3>üåç Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        Our long-term vision is to make Firefly fianncially-accessible to those who need it most. In the short term, we're focused on getting Fireflies into the
        hands of Ethereum developers ‚Äî IRL.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-block">
      <h3>üéÆ Fun</h3>
      <p>
        Firefly is meant to be fun. It runs games. It animates. You can skin it, flash it, modify it.
        We believe that joy is part of security ‚Äî and that Ethereum tools can be playful, weird, and personal.

  <h2>Our Story</h2> 
  <p> Firefly was born in April 2017 when  <a href="https://github.com/ricmoo" target="_blank">RicMoo</a> (Richard Moore) and <a href="https://github.com/yuetloo" target="_blank">YuetLoo</a> created a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnWV1jVuah6/" target="_blank">hardware wallet</a> to store Richard's prized crypto kitty as their entry for a Blockgeeks Lab Blockchain Hackathon. The team placed second at the hackathon, and went on to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6r48kb/firefly_the_5_diy_airgap_hardware_wallet/">continue building</a> the Firefly hardware wallet.</p>
  
  <p>
    Richard is the founder and maintainer of <a href="https://docs.ethers.org/v6/" target="_blank">Ethers JS</a>, a library to help developers build on Ethereum that is <a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=ethers&from=2020-01-20&to=2025-07-20" target="_blank">downloaded millions of times</a> per week. Ethers grew in popularity from 2018 to today leaving little time to dedicate to Firefly. However in 2022, with Ethers V6 released and account abstraction on the horizon, the timing felt perfect to revive Firefly. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    In the six months from August 2022 to January 2023, the <a href="https://github.com/firefly/pixie-device" target="_blank">Firelfy Pixie</a> underwent several iterations, from Rev 2 to to Rev 6 ‚Äî which continues to be the version used in Firefly DevKits. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We're currently working on <a href="https://github.com/firefly/pixie-firmware" target="_blank">hardware wallet firmware</a> for the Firefly Pixie and developer tools to make it easier to build and customize Firefly firmware.
  </p>
  <p>
    In July 2023 the team attended <a href="/updates/firefly-at-ethcc-2024-in-brussels" target="_blank">ETHCC 7 in Brussels</a>. It was the first time we were able to get Firefly devices into the hands of developers. As well as Brussels, the Firefly team has attended <a href="/updates/firefly-at-devcon-7-in-bangkok" target="_blank">DevCon in Bangkok</a> and <a href="/updates/firefly-at-ethcc-2025-in-cannes" target="_blank">ETHCC 8 in Cannes</a>. We plan to give away the most Firefly DevKits yet at DevConnect in Buenos Aires in November this year.
  </p>
  <p> The Firefly Pixie DevKit is our first release. Devices and firmware can be modified or independently developed. Everything you need is on our <a href="https://github.com/firefly" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
